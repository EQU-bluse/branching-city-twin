    A branch is created from an existing event and grows only by appending
    events whose sole parent is the branch's current head, so branches
    never move each other's heads. Appends are idempotent: the store
    records the ``(at, changes)`` each branch appended under an event id,
    and repeating the same call is a no-op. All validation finishes before
    any state is touched, so a failed call leaves the graph, branch heads
    and idempotency records unchanged.
